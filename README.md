Guitar Thing
====

It's a virtual guitar record-a-synthsize-amatronic-uh-- thing.

You can copy and paste entire webpages containing guitar tabs and it'll try to load all it can.




Uses <a href="https://github.com/Dinahmoe/tuna">tuna.js</a> audio effects library.

## TODO

* Better mobile support
  (You can't even play back notes!)
