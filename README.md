Guitar
======

It's a virtual guitar record-a-synthsize-amatronic-uh-- thing.

You can copy and paste entire webpages containing guitar tabs and it'll try to load all it can.




Uses <a href="https://github.com/Dinahmoe/tuna">tuna.js</a> audio effects library.

## TODO

* Better mobile support
  (You can't even play back notes!)

* Tablature parsing that doesn't take really long or crash due to
  (not-particularlywell-thought-out) regular expressions

* Fix tablature parsing because it's completely broken

* Support for different tunings?

* Find a better way to fade out
  (that doesn't end abruptly especially when amplified)

* Allow configuring the effects chain
  (at least toggle distortion on/off)

* Tablature view that isn't just a text area
  (show current song position, allow block-level editing)
